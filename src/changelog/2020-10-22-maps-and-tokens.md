- Updated how viewing and sharing maps/images works. Now, when you are viewing a map privately and someone else shares a map to the table, your private view remains up and a new thumbnail for the shared map will appear on the table. You will now be able to swtich between the asset you were viewing privately and the one shared to the party.
- Updated how drawing and token placement works. Any issues with lines or tokens jumping around should now be fixed.
- Fixed a bug where players couldn't move tokens or draw on a map being shared with the table.
- Fixed a scaling issue with tokens and drawings. Before if you scaled a token or drew a line on high density screen, those tokens and lines would appear too large on regular screens. Now everything should appear the same regardless of screen pixel density.
