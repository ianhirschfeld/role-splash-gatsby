We've been hard at work continuing to improve things and fix bugs from our initial batch of players. Most importantly we've fixed some bugs that caused crashing while using map & tokens, or rolling dice.

We've also added the ability to be able to create multiple sheets within a Table. Just click on your first sheet's avatar to reveal a menu allowing you to add an additional sheet!
