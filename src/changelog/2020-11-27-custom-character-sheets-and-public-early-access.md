Role is coming out of Private Early Access and inviting all to join us in testing and improving Role! With Public Early Access we hope to onboard even more players to enjoy the platform, help us find bugs, and join our community of adventurers!

Custom Sheet Templates are here! We are releasing v1 of our Template Creator which allows creators and players alike a first look at our toolset for creating character sheets and more. You can view a tutorial below:
