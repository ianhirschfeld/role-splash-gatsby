- Added the ability to copy sheets from your dashboard. While viewing a sheet on your dashboard, the sheet's settings (gear icon) is now clickable and has an option for creating a copy of the sheet. This will copy the sheet in its entirety including all its info, and will immediately be selected for viewing.
- Fixed being able to upload assets in Safari.
- Fixed random maps/images showing up when first entering a table.
- Fixed network quality indicators sometimes not showing up for users when in a video call.
