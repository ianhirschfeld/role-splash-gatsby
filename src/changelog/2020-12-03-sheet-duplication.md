- Templates that have blocks marked with "Duplication" will now work. Blocks on sheets will now have an "Add" button that will duplicate those inputs into a new block a player can use. In the Template Creator you can also use the symbol "%n" to have your duplicated blocks automatically numbered.
- We increased the scrollable area in the Template Creator to extend all the way to the right of your browser.
- Updated some sheet template styles.
- Fixed an issue where a List Item toggle with just a description was not clickable.
- Fixed an issue causing crashes when trying to open the Advanced Options panel in the Template Creator.
