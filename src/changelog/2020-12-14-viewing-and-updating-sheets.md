- You can now view and edit your sheets right from your Dashboard!
- On your dashboard, sheets will now display a "Sheet Update Available" message when the sheet's template has been changed. Updating a sheet will change it to match the updated template. If there is information that doesn't fit on the updated template, a Rollover sheet will be created to preserve your data.
