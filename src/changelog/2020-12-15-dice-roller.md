- We've added support for Two-Sided dice and Fate/Fudge dice.
- The Dice Roller now allows you to re-roll all dice! Instead of a "Done" button, we've updated it to be a "Re-roll" button. You can dismiss the Dice Roller by clicking the X in the top right corner of the modal.
- You can now re-roll a single die by clicking within it's circle in the Dice Roller.
- Fixed the Dice Roller showing the proper total if you add additional dice after rolling once.
