title: Maps and Sheets Fixes
version: 0.11.1

- Fixed private sheets sometimes being visible to other players at the table. This could happen if you had both private AND shared sheets at the table.
- Fixed getting stuck with a map open and either a) not being able to select it again or b) not being able to close it. This was caused when viewing a private map while another map was being shared.
- Fixed unsharing a map if the person who shared it leaves the table or refreshes the page.
